        <p>This is basically a guide to being nice, I guess.

        <p>Lots of good points but I would be very careful on following some of
        the advices in this day and age. Also quite long-winded/repetitive,
        contains various strange / illogical metaphors and unrealistic / absurd
        stories.

        <p>There is one about the Colorado fuel company strike (1914), in which the
        author said:

        <blockquote>[The Rockefeller speech] presented facts in such a friendly
        manner that the strikers went back to work without saying another word
        about the increase in wages for which they had fought so
        violently.</blockquote>

        <p>To me this is not at all a fair representation of what happened. To
        contrast, here is Wikipedia says:

        <blockquote>The United Mine Workers of America finally ran out of money,
        and called off the strike on December 10, 1914. In the end, the
        strikers' demands were not met, the union did not obtain recognition,
        and many striking workers were replaced. 408 strikers were arrested, 332
        of whom were indicted for murder.</blockquote>

        <p>This casts doubt on the accuracy of the other quite absurd stories in
        this book.
